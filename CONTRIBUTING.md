# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in ActorCoreBluetooth!

This project is actively evolving, and contributions, ideas, and feedback are very welcome.

## How to get involved

If you have an idea for a feature, API improvement, or behavior change:
- please consider starting a GitHub Discussion to describe the idea and motivation
- early discussion helps align on design and concurrency constraints

Small improvements, experiments, and fixes are welcome as pull requests without prior discussion.

## Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused on a single logical change
- Follow existing code style and concurrency patterns
- Prefer clarity and correctness over cleverness
- If a change affects public API or concurrency guarantees, please mention it explicitly

## Design principles

ActorCoreBluetooth is built around:
- actor isolation
- async/await–based APIs
- explicit concurrency boundaries

Please keep these principles in mind when proposing changes.

Thanks for helping improve the project!
